# dis_system

This is my first web app project I made. It is made full by scratch in HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. It has the main login index.html page where you can log in to the system. 
If you enter the wrong username and password, the IP address is stored in a database. 
After successful login, you are forwarded to the Admin Actions page where you can choose options. The system is organized as a small information system where you can store informations about
people, cars, and real estate.

The project has main action, system actions, js, and CSS folders. In actions, a folder is stored PHP files that communicate with the MySQL database. 
In the system, actions are HTML and PHP files what are direct user interface files.
JS folder is javascript files folder, and in CSS folder is CSS files.

For this project, I also used Bootstrap framework for osoba.php file.
